# RL-for-Anomaly

This Repo contains some Poc level code snippets to train the time series anomaly detection using 
  Reinforcement learnning Algorithms
There is lot be added in this space


TODO:

Have a Generic Time series Dashboard to Annotate anomalies for the Given data 
  - Use some learning technique to speed up the labelling (manual-labour intensive process)
  - Collect the labelled anomaly detection as separate dataset which is able to combine with rest of the
    features used to train ML models
  - Speed up the label function by also using clustering/statistical /distance measure to aid with the 
    Human Oracle to flag an anomaly
